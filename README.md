This small repo is a sample of our integration with a LLM Vendor. 
Your task is to implement integration with Anthropic's Claude by deriving claude_llm_call.Model 
from the class llm_call.LLM, and implementing it's functionality. 

To test, copy file tests/test_together_llama.py to tests/test_claude.py, replace the code with 
calls to Claude, and record the results.
